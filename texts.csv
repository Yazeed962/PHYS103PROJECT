1,"Here's a few fun facts about the ISS:
- The ISS is located in low earth orbit, it rotates around the earth at an altitude ranging from 350 to 400 kilometers.
- It took 136 space flights to complete the International Space Station.
- The ISS is the third brightest object in the night sky (The moon and Venus are the only brighter objects).
- The crew members of the ISS have internet access which they use for entertainment and communication purposes. (They got you covered ;))
- The ISS is the largest manned object mankind has ever put into space.
- The ISS is the most expensive object mankind has ever made, costing more than $120 billion.",rocket/rocket_1.gif,See? That was not very hard. You have unlocked the first part of the ship!,,iss.jpg
2,"In around 340 BC. The greek philosopher Aristotle put two arguments that the earth was spherical rather than flat. His first argument was that in the case of an eclipse,
the earth's shadow completely covers the moon. If the earth was flat, its shadow would not cover the moon completely, it would have an elongated elliptical shadow on the moon. The second argument was that the Greeks knew from their travels that the North Star sits vertically over the north pole. They noticed that the North Star appeared lower in the sky the more they moved towards the south.",rocket/rocket_2.gif, It didn't take smart people so much about 2000 years ago to figure it out. Can you believe that it is 2020 and some people still think the earth is flat? Everybody knows that the earth is dinasour shaped :p,,dinasour.jpg
3,"For some reason, Aristotle believed that the earth was the center of the universe. 
He claimed that the earth is stationary and everything else rotates around it. This idea was later adopted by Ptolemy in 2 A.D. 
Ptolemy built a complete cosmological model, where the earth stood still at the center and it was surrounded by 8 spheres. These spheres carried the moon, the sun, the stars and the five planets known at the time, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. ",rocket/rocket_3.gif, I mean.. Aristotle is cool but he wasn't always right. You just unlocked the third part of your ship!,,ptolemaic_model.png
4,"Light is cool right? You know what else is cool? Research conducted about light. Is it a wave? Is it a particle? Well, the best answer to this question is YES. In 1678, Huygnes suggested that light was a form of waves since it displays wave properties. Everybody liked that and the subject of light was closed. You know who didn't like that though? Big. hot. radioactive stuff. And Planck. and Einstein relatively (no pun intended). Some calculations in the early 1900s showed that a hot object such as a star ought to radiate energy at an infinite rate. This was ridiculous. It violated everything we knew about thermodynamics. Max Planck manned up and honestly, he lived up to the expectations. Or maybe higher. He proposed that waves were emitted in packets he called quanta. Each quantum carries a certain amount of energy, which is directly proportional to the frequency. At a certain high frequency, the emission of a single quantum would require more energy than available, therefore the radiation at high frequencies would be reduced and boom. Finite energy. BALANCE.

5,"We said that Einstein wasn't exactly the biggest fan of light is a wave hypothesis so he decided to conduct an experiment called the photoelectric effect. The experiment was about inducing an electric current by shining a light on an electrode. The results of this experiment were intriguing, in fact, this was one of the biggest contributions in the history of quantum physics (we all know Einstein didn�t probably like it but what can we say? Science is science). In the experiment, Einstein demonstrated that the frequency in fact affects the energy carried by photons, which is something the other hypothesis did not support. In addition to that, he observed that an electrical current was induced immediately as the light was shined, this as well proves that light behaves as a particle, since the other hypothesis suggests that the electrode has to �heat up� first before it starts inducing current. The photoelectric effect, along with his other contributions to the scientific society got Einstein a Nobel Prize, to preserve his name as one of the greatest scientists of all time.",rocket/rocket_5.gif,,  ,sad.png
